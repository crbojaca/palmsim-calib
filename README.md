# README

Welcome to PalmSim, a field-scale oil palm production model written in Python.

# Getting Started

The easiest way to get started is by having a look at the Jupyter notebooks in the examples folder.

If you can not open Jupyter notebooks yet or dont know what they are, see the install guide section.

At some point you can also find a useful guide/reference in the documentation folder.

# Install Guide

To get started, install Python 3 and make sure you can open Jupyter notebooks.

The easiest way to do so, is to install Python via the Anaconda distribution.

See https://anaconda.com/download/

For information on Jupyter notebooks, please search the internet. There are lots of good explanations available.
